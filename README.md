# The-Best-Classifier
In this project I used various machine learning algorithms to build a model which can predict LOAN STATUS. 

I used the following algorithms to build my models:

  1. k-Nearest Neighbour
  2. Decision Tree
  3. Support Vector Machine
  4. Logistic Regression
  
The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

  1. Jaccard index
  2. F1-score
  3. LogLoass
